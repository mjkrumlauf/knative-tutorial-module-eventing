[#eventing-source]
== Event Source

*Knative Eventing Sources* are software components that emit events.  The job of a Source is to connect to, drain, capture and potentially buffer events; often from an external system and then relay those events to the *Sink*.

Knative Eventing Sources installs the following four sources out-of-the-box:

[#eventing-get-api-resources]
[.console-input]
[source,bash,subs="+macros,+attributes"]
----
kubectl api-resources --api-group='sources.knative.dev'
----

[.console-output]
[source,bash]
----
NAME              APIGROUP                      NAMESPACED   KIND
apiserversources  sources.knative.dev           true         ApiServerSource
containersources  sources.knative.dev           true         ContainerSource
pingsources       sources.knative.dev           true         PingSource
sinkbindings      sources.knative.dev           true         SinkBinding
----

Let's see how a simple source, the *PingSource* looks like : 

.link:{github-repo}/{eventing-repo}/eventinghello-source.yaml[eventinghello-source.yaml]
[source,yaml,subs="attributes+,+macros"]
----
apiVersion: sources.knative.dev/v1alpha2
kind: PingSource #<1>
metadata:
  name: eventinghello-ping-source
spec: #<2>
  schedule: "*/2 * * * *"
  jsonData: '{"key": "every 2 mins"}'
  sink:
    ref:
      apiVersion: serving.knative.dev/v1
      kind: Service
      name: eventinghello
----

<1> The type of event source, the eventing system deploys a bunch of sources out of the box and it also provides way to deploy custom resources
<2> spec will be unique per source, per kind


[#eventing-sink]
== Referencing the Event Sink

*Knative Eventing Sink* is how you specify the event receiver -- that is the consumer of the event--. Sinks can be invoked directly in a point-to-point fashion by referencing them via the Event Source's `sink` as shown below:

.link:{github-repo}/{eventing-repo}/eventinghello-source.yaml[eventinghello-source.yaml]
[source,yaml,subs="attributes+,+macros"]
----
apiVersion: sources.knative.dev/v1alpha2
kind: PingSource
metadata:
  name: eventinghello-ping-source
spec:
  schedule: "*/2 * * * *"
  jsonData: '{"message": "Thanks for doing Knative Tutorial"}'
  sink:  #<1>
    ref:
      apiVersion: serving.knative.dev/v1 #<2>
      kind: Service
      name: eventinghello #<3>
----

<1> sink can target any Kubernetes Service or 
<2> a Knative Service
<3> Deployed as "eventinghello"

[NOTE]
====
Event Source can define the attributes that it wishes to receive via the 
spec.  In the above example it defines **schedule**(the cron expression) and **jsonData** that will be sent as part of the event.

When you xref:{eventing-repo}#eventing-watch-logs[watch logs], you will notice this data being delivered to the service.
====

[#eventing-sink-service]
== Create Sink Service 

Run the following command to create the Knative service that will be used as the subscriber for the cron events:

.link:{github-repo}/{eventing-repo}/eventinghello-sink.yaml[eventinghello-sink.yaml]
[source,yaml,subs="attributes+,+macros"]
----
include::ROOT:example$eventing/eventinghello-sink.yaml[]
----

[#eventing-deploy-sink-service]
=== Deploy Sink Service

Run the following commands to create the service:

:doc-sec: deploy-sink-service
:url: {github-repo}/{eventing-repo}/eventing/eventinghello-sink.yaml
:url-alt-text: eventinghello-sink.yaml
include::ROOT:partial$deploy-knative-resources.adoc[]

[#eventing-create-event-source]
== Create Event Source

Run the following commands to create the event source resources:

:doc-sec: event-src-svc
:url: {github-repo}/{eventing-repo}/eventinghello-source.yaml
:url-alt-text: eventinghello-source.yaml
include::ROOT:partial$deploy-knative-resources.adoc[]

[#eventing-verify-event-source]
== Verification

[#eventing-run-verify-event-source]
[.console-input]
[source,bash,subs="+macros,+attributes"]
----
kubectl -n {tutorial-namespace} get \
  pingsources.sources.knative.dev \
  eventinghello-ping-source
----

Running  the above command should return the following result:

[.console-output]
[source,bash]
----
NAME                       AGE
eventinghello-ping-source  39s
----

You can xref:{eventing-repo}/eventing.adoc#eventing-watch-logs[watch logs] to see the ping job source sending an event every 1 minute.
